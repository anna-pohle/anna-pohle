## 🧠 About Me

With a Master's degree in linguistics and a background in **research**, **team leadership**, and **production planning**, I bring a keen eye for detail and a strong sense of structure.

I'm currently transitioning into **Quality Assurance (QA)** with [Masterschool](https://de.masterschool.com/domains/qa-engineering-14-months/) and gaining hands-on experience in **manual testing** as well as **test automation with Python, Selenium, and Playwright**.  

I enjoy designing **robust test scripts** using **CSS selectors, XPath, and semantic locators**, and experimenting with automation frameworks to improve efficiency and reliability. I thrive in teams that value clarity, curiosity, and user-focused thinking.
