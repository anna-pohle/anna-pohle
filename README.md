## 🧠 About Me

With a Master's degree in linguistics and a background in **research**, **team leadership**, and **production planning**, I bring a keen eye for detail and a strong sense of structure.

I'm currently transitioning into **Quality Assurance (QA)** with [Masterschool](https://de.masterschool.com/domains/qa-engineering-14-months/) and gaining hands-on experience in **manual testing** and **test automation with Python and Selenium**. I thrive in teams that value clarity, curiosity, and user-focused thinking.
